# Data Science portfolio by Andrew King
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. 
# [Project 1: Fake News Detector](https://github.com/AKing2713/AndrewKing_Portfolio/blob/main/FakeNewsDetector/FakeNewsDetector.ipynb)
* Used Tfidf Vectorizer to transform raw news text into TF-IDF(Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) matrix.
* Applied the transformed data to a Passive Agress Classifier to correctly identify fake news.
