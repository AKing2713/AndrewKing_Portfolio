# Data Science portfolio by Andrew King
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.
# [Project 1: Loan Application Prediction](https://github.com/AKing2713/AndrewKing_Portfolio/blob/main/LoanPrediction/loan_predication.ipynb)
* Performed exploratory data analysis with various python libraries(numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Transformed data in various ways to include:
  * Imputing missing values using mode and median
  * Performed a log transformation on data to normalzie and reduce outliers
  * Created new features
* Trained a Logistic Regression model to make predictions on a test set.
# [Project 2: Fake News Detector](https://github.com/AKing2713/AndrewKing_Portfolio/blob/main/FakeNewsDetector/FakeNewsDetector.ipynb)
* Used Tfidf Vectorizer to transform raw news text into TF-IDF(Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) matrix.
* Applied the transformed data to a Passive Agress Classifier to correctly identify fake news.
